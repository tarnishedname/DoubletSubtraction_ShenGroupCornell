The Igor procedure file "THE DOUBLET CODE.ipf" contains all the doublet subtraction code. It has been annotated for user-friendliness


For an example of how to use it, download the Igor experiment file "EXAMPLE EXPERIMENT.pxp", open the Igor experiment and look under Procedures. Instructions follow on the procedure window. They are also repeated here

//Hello! Here's an example of how to use this code: 
//"root:Example_NeI_Data_Bi2Se3:NeI_presubtracted" is an example ARPES images of single crystal Bi2Se3
//Note that is has been converted from angle to momentum on the x-axis.
//Set "Example_NeI_Data_Bi2Se3" as your current data folder
//Run "BetaSubtraction_(NeI_presubtracted, 0.176, 0.25)"
